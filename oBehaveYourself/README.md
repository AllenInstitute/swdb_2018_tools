# oBehave
Development for the o'Behave Yourself team.
Created By Yoni Browning, Sol Bernardez, and Deepa Ramamurthy.

Yoni and Sol have partitioned their scripts into YoniAnalysis and SolAnalysis folders, please contact them directly if you have any specific questions about any of these scripts.

o'Behave is a pip installable package that all members of the team contributed to. If you have questions about this or other un-named items of code please (1) refer to the comments in the script in question (we tried to write our names on things) or (2) contact the team and we should be able to either help, or refer you to which ever team member can.
